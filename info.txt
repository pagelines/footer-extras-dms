== Description ==

Footer Extras DMS puts a few extra items below your footer area that are nice to have but don't need to be displayed prominently.

• Display a dynamically generated copyright notice with the year(s) pulled from your first and last published posts.

• Show your business name, address and phone (NAP) in schema.org format for local search. Still useful even if you aren't a local business.

• Space for an additional line of text, ideal for web designer credit and link.
